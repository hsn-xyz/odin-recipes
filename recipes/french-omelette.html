<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A true <strong>French</strong> omelette, or omelet as Americans call it, is just eggs and butter, no filling.</p>
<p>The egg is folded for a soft, <em>tender texture</em>.</p>
<p>It's <strong>10% ingredients and 90% technique</strong>, so it does take a bit of practice to perfect.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
 
  <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon cold water</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
  <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
  
  </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl.
   <br>Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
   As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. 
   <br>Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. 
  <br> Continue stirring until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness.
  <br> As soon as the surface is wet but not runny, remove from heat.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side of the pan. 
  <br>Use the spatula to fold the last flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push the butter as it melts under the omelette.
</p></li>
<li><p>Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if necessary.
  <br> You can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a bit more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper. <strong>Enjoy with toasted bread and a fresh Salad!</strong></p></li>
